> Alignment process
> Parameters:
> Representation method: Voss_indicators || Kmer size: 250
> Transformation method: DFT || Transformation level: 8
> Number of K-NN neighbours considered: 5
> Exhaustive comparison: OFF
> Non randomly shuffle reads: ON

> Process:
> Importing reference genome and creating transformations for 18940 kmers elapse time: 1 seconds
> Creating tree for  18940 reads elapse time: 0 seconds.
> Start importing reads from the fastq file.
> Importing 2113 reads from the fastq file and creating transformations elapse time: 0 seconds.
> Performing 5-NN neighbours search for 2113 reads elapse time: 1.49247 seconds.
> Minimum query search comparisons performed on the VP-tree: 11
> Maximum query search comparisons performed on the VP-tree: 595
> Average query search comparisons performed on the VP-tree: 164.
> Average abandon search: 32
> Average search time: 0 seconds
> Creating SAM file elapse time 0.
> Overall alignment time 2 in seconds.
