> Alignment process
> Parameters:
> Representation method: Voss_indicators || Kmer size: 300
> Transformation method: DFT || Transformation level: 8
> Number of K-NN neighbours considered: 5
> Exhaustive comparison: OFF
> Non randomly shuffle reads: ON

> Process:
> Importing reference genome and creating transformations for 18840 kmers elapse time: 1 seconds
> Creating tree for  18840 reads elapse time: 0 seconds.
> Start importing reads from the fastq file.
> Importing 2113 reads from the fastq file and creating transformations elapse time: 0 seconds.
> Performing 5-NN neighbours search for 2113 reads elapse time: 1.26274 seconds.
> Minimum query search comparisons performed on the VP-tree: 10
> Maximum query search comparisons performed on the VP-tree: 421
> Average query search comparisons performed on the VP-tree: 99.
> Average abandon search: 20
> Average search time: 0 seconds
> Creating SAM file elapse time 0.
> Overall alignment time 3 in seconds.
