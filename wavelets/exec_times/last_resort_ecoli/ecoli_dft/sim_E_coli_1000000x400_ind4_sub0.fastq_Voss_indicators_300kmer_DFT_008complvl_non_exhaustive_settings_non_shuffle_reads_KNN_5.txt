> Alignment process
> Parameters:
> Representation method: Voss_indicators || Kmer size: 300
> Transformation method: DFT || Transformation level: 8
> Number of K-NN neighbours considered: 5
> Exhaustive comparison: OFF
> Non randomly shuffle reads: ON

> Process:
> Importing reference genome and creating transformations for 9282706 kmers elapse time: 805 seconds
> Creating tree for  9282706 reads elapse time: 137 seconds.
> Start importing reads from the fastq file.
> Importing 1000000 reads from the fastq file and creating transformations elapse time: 102 seconds.
> Performing 5-NN neighbours search for 1000000 reads elapse time: 3519.42 seconds.
> Minimum query search comparisons performed on the VP-tree: 19
> Maximum query search comparisons performed on the VP-tree: 20588
> Average query search comparisons performed on the VP-tree: 3130.
> Average abandon search: 562
> Average search time: 0 seconds
> Creating SAM file elapse time 104.
> Overall alignment time 4670 in seconds.
